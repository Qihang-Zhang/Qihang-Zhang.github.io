My name is Qi Yan (颜齐). 
I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) department at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), co-supervised by [Prof. Renjie Liao](https://ece.ubc.ca/renjie-liao/) and [Prof. Lele Wang](https://ece.ubc.ca/lele-wang/).
	I am broadly interested in machine learning, self-driving, and robotics.

**Previously**: I obtained my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in 2022, where I worked with [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi/?lang=en), [Dr. Iordan Doytchinov](https://people.epfl.ch/iordan.doytchinov/?lang=en), and [Prof. Bertrand Merminod](https://people.epfl.ch/bertrand.merminod?lang=en) on [robot trajectory planning](https://socialnce.github.io/) and [visual localization](https://crossloc.github.io/).
I received my bachelor's degree in Nuclear Engineering (Honors) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019.
Back then, I worked with [Prof. Solmaz Kia](http://solmaz.eng.uci.edu/) and [Prof. Li Jiang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/) on multi-robot cooperative localization and [Prof. Xianghui Meng](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/mengxianghui.html) on robot manipulator control.
