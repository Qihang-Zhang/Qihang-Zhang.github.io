Hello here is Qihang. 
I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) department at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), co-supervised by [Prof. Renjie Liao](https://ece.ubc.ca/renjie-liao/) and [Prof. Lele Wang](https://ece.ubc.ca/lele-wang/). I am broadly interested in machine learning.

**Previously:** I received my bachelor's degree in [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2023.
I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Gao Huang](https://www.gaohuang.net/) during my undergraduate study.

Please refer to my [curriculum vitae](./assets/pdf/CV_QiYan.pdf) if you are interested.

**DAgrad:** My friends and I Created [DAgrad](https://dagrad.site/), where we have shared ***EECS*** graduate school admission results from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), China! We're passionate to expand to more universities and countries soon to build a community for EECS graduate applications. If you're passionate about similar idea, feel free to contact me!
